# Medication Reminder Feature

## Overview
The Medication Reminder feature allows users to manage their medications with full backend integration using Firebase Firestore. Each user can only see and manage their own medications, ensuring complete data privacy and security.

## Features

### üîê User-Specific Data
- All medications are tied to the authenticated user's ID
- Users can only view, add, edit, and delete their own medications
- Secure Firestore rules prevent unauthorized access

### üíä Medication Management
- **Add Medications**: Users can add new medications with details like:
  - Medication name
  - Dosage
  - Frequency
  - Reminder times (up to 5 times per day)
  - Optional notes
- **Toggle Status**: Enable/disable medications with a simple switch
- **Delete Medications**: Remove medications with confirmation dialog
- **View All**: See all medications in a clean, organized list

### üîÑ Real-time Updates
- Medications are automatically loaded when the user logs in
- Changes are immediately reflected in the UI
- Proper loading states and error handling

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Services
- **Firebase Firestore**: Database for storing medication data
- **Firebase Authentication**: User authentication and authorization
- **Security Rules**: Firestore rules ensure data privacy

### Frontend Components
- **MedicationService**: Handles all CRUD operations with Firestore
- **useMedications Hook**: Custom hook for state management
- **Medication Reminder Screen**: Main UI component

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Medication {
  id?: string;
  userId: string;        // Links to authenticated user
  name: string;          // Medication name
  dosage: string;        // Dosage information
  frequency: string;     // How often to take
  time: string[];        // Array of reminder times
  notes?: string;        // Optional notes
  active: boolean;       // Whether medication is active
  createdAt?: any;       // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt?: any;       // Last update timestamp
}
```

## Security Features

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
// Users can only access their own medications
match /medications/{medicationId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
}
```

### Authentication Checks
- All operations require user authentication
- User ID is automatically included in all medication records
- Unauthorized users see an authentication required message

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Login**: Must be authenticated to access medication features
2. **Add Medication**: Tap "Add New Medication" and fill in the required fields
3. **Manage Medications**: Toggle active status, edit, or delete existing medications
4. **View Medications**: See all medications in a clean, organized list

### For Developers
1. **Service Layer**: Use `medicationService` for all database operations
2. **Hook**: Use `useMedications` hook for state management
3. **Authentication**: Ensure user is authenticated before accessing features
4. **Error Handling**: All operations include proper error handling and user feedback

## Recent Fixes

### ‚úÖ Fixed Firebase Undefined Value Error
- **Issue**: Firebase Firestore doesn't allow `undefined` values in documents
- **Solution**: Convert `undefined` notes to `null` and filter out all undefined values
- **Impact**: Medications can now be added successfully without errors

### üîß Data Validation
- Enhanced input validation for medication fields
- Proper handling of empty notes and time slots
- Trim whitespace from all text inputs
