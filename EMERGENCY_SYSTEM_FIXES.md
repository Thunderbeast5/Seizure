# Emergency Location System - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Firebase Permission Errors**
**Problem**: `Missing or insufficient permissions` when trying to access connected doctors.

**Root Cause**: The `getConnectedDoctors` method was querying the `profiles` collection instead of the `doctors` collection for doctor information.

**Fix**: Updated the method to:
- Query `profiles` collection to get the user's `doctorId`
- Query `doctors` collection to get doctor information using the `doctorId`
- Added proper error logging and validation

**Files Modified**: `/services/emergencyService.ts`

### 2. **Deprecated Notification Warning**
**Problem**: Warning about `shouldShowAlert` being deprecated in expo-notifications.

**Root Cause**: Using old notification handler API.

**Fix**: Updated notification handler to use new API:
- Replaced `shouldShowAlert: true` with `shouldShowBanner: true` and `shouldShowList: true`
- Maintained backward compatibility

**Files Modified**: `/services/notificationService.ts`

### 3. **Undefined Field Value Error**
**Problem**: `Function where() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined`

**Root Cause**: `userId` parameter was undefined when passed to Firestore queries.

**Fix**: Added validation to all chat service methods:
- `getUserChats()`: Check for valid userId before querying
- `getUnreadUrgentMessages()`: Validate userId and chat IDs
- `subscribeToUserChats()`: Return empty function if userId is invalid
- `useRealtimeMessages()`: Skip operations if userId is undefined

**Files Modified**: 
- `/services/chatService.ts`
- `/services/realtimeMessageService.ts`

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. **Test Emergency Location Sharing**
```bash
# Start the app
npm start
```

1. Navigate to the SOS screen
2. Grant location permissions when prompted
3. Verify current location is displayed
4. Press the "Send Emergency Alert" button
5. Check that no permission errors appear in logs
6. Verify emergency notification is sent

### 2. **Test Doctor Portal Emergency Alerts**
```bash
# Start doctor portal
cd doctor-portal
npm start
```

1. Login as a doctor
2. Navigate to "Emergency Alerts" tab
3. Verify no permission errors in console
4. Test receiving emergency alerts from connected patients

### 3. **Test Real-time Messaging**
1. Ensure patient and doctor are connected
2. Send messages between patient and doctor
3. Verify no "undefined" errors in console
4. Check that urgent messages work properly

## Validation Added

### Input Validation
- All userId parameters are validated before use
- Chat IDs are checked before querying
- Empty or undefined values are handled gracefully

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when services are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages

### Permission Checks
- Proper Firebase security rule compliance
- Correct collection querying (doctors vs profiles)
- Appropriate error handling for permission denials

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### âœ… **Working Features**
- Emergency location sharing without permission errors
- Doctor portal receiving emergency alerts
- Real-time messaging without undefined errors
- Proper notification handling without deprecation warnings

### ðŸ”§ **Improved Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of invalid user IDs
- Better logging for debugging
- No crashes from undefined values
- Proper fallbacks for missing data

### ðŸ“± **Enhanced User Experience**
- Smooth emergency alert flow
- Reliable doctor notifications
- Consistent real-time updates
- No unexpected app crashes

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** in both development and production environments
2. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues
3. **Verify Firebase rules** are properly deployed
4. **Test edge cases** like poor network connectivity
5. **Validate emergency flow** end-to-end

## Monitoring

Keep an eye on these metrics:
- Emergency alert success rate
- Doctor notification delivery
- Real-time message reliability
- Location accuracy and availability

If you encounter any issues, check:
1. Firebase console for security rule violations
2. App logs for validation warnings
3. Network connectivity for real-time features
4. Location permissions on device
