# Emergency Location Sharing System

## Overview

The Emergency Location Sharing System enables patients to instantly share their precise location with doctors and emergency contacts when the SOS button is pressed. This critical feature ensures immediate medical assistance can be dispatched to the exact location during seizure emergencies.

## Key Features

### üö® **Instant Location Sharing**
- **GPS Precision**: Uses device GPS to get accurate location coordinates
- **Address Resolution**: Converts coordinates to readable addresses using reverse geocoding
- **Real-time Updates**: Location is fetched in real-time when SOS is triggered
- **Fallback Support**: Works even when precise location isn't available

### üì± **Patient Mobile App Features**
- **Current Location Display**: Shows patient's current location with accuracy
- **One-Tap Emergency**: Single button press to send location-based alerts
- **Location Refresh**: Manual refresh button to update current position
- **Maps Integration**: Direct link to open location in device's maps app
- **Permission Management**: Handles location permissions gracefully

### üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Doctor Portal Features**
- **Emergency Alerts Dashboard**: Dedicated tab for monitoring patient emergencies
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant alerts when patients trigger SOS
- **Location Visualization**: Click to view patient location on Google Maps
- **Alert Management**: Acknowledge and resolve emergency alerts
- **Patient Context**: Full patient information with emergency details

## Technical Implementation

### Core Services

#### 1. **LocationService** (`/services/locationService.ts`)
```typescript
// Key capabilities:
- requestLocationPermissions(): Promise<LocationPermissionStatus>
- getCurrentLocation(): Promise<LocationData | null>
- startLocationTracking(): Promise<boolean>
- reverseGeocode(): Promise<string>
- generateMapsUrl(): string
```

#### 2. **EmergencyService** (`/services/emergencyService.ts`)
```typescript
// Key capabilities:
- sendEmergencyAlert(): Promise<EmergencyAlert | null>
- updateAlertStatus(): Promise<void>
- callEmergencyServices(): Promise<void>
- openLocationInMaps(): Promise<void>
```

### Data Structure

#### EmergencyAlert Interface
```typescript
interface EmergencyAlert {
  id?: string;
  userId: string;
  userEmail: string;
  userName: string;
  alertType: 'seizure' | 'medical' | 'general';
  location: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    accuracy: number | null;
    timestamp: number;
    address?: string;
  };
  timestamp: number;
  status: 'active' | 'acknowledged' | 'resolved';
  message?: string;
  contactsNotified: string[];
  doctorNotified: boolean;
  emergencyServicesContacted: boolean;
}
```

### Location Data Flow

1. **Permission Request**: App requests location permissions on startup
2. **Location Acquisition**: GPS coordinates fetched when SOS screen loads
3. **Emergency Trigger**: User presses SOS button
4. **Alert Creation**: Emergency alert created with current location
5. **Multi-Channel Notification**:
   - Emergency contacts notified via SMS/calls
   - Connected doctors receive instant alerts
   - Push notifications sent to patient's other devices
6. **Doctor Response**: Doctors can view location and respond immediately

## Security & Privacy

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
// Emergency alerts - users can read/write their own, doctors can read/write assigned patients' alerts
match /emergencyAlerts/{alertId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
  // Doctors can read/write emergency alerts of patients assigned to them
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/doctors/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/profiles/$(resource.data.userId)) &&
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/profiles/$(resource.data.userId)).data.doctorId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

### Privacy Considerations
- **Location data is only shared during emergencies**
- **Automatic cleanup of old emergency alerts**
- **Secure transmission using Firebase Firestore**
- **Doctor access limited to assigned patients only**

## User Experience

### Patient App Flow
1. **Location Setup**: App requests location permissions
2. **Current Location**: Displays current address and coordinates
3. **Emergency Button**: Large, prominent SOS button
4. **Confirmation**: Shows location being shared with contacts/doctors
5. **Follow-up**: Options to call 911 or update emergency contacts

### Doctor Portal Flow
1. **Alert Notification**: Real-time popup when patient triggers SOS
2. **Emergency Dashboard**: Dedicated tab showing all active alerts
3. **Location Access**: One-click to view patient location on maps
4. **Status Management**: Acknowledge and resolve alerts
5. **Communication**: Direct messaging with patient about emergency

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems Integration
- **Chat System**: Emergency alerts trigger urgent messages
- **Notification System**: Uses existing push notification infrastructure
- **Real-time Data**: Leverages Firebase real-time listeners
- **Authentication**: Integrates with existing user/doctor authentication

### External Services
- **Google Maps**: Location visualization and navigation
- **Device GPS**: High-accuracy location services
- **Push Notifications**: Cross-platform emergency alerts

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Dependencies Installation
```bash
# Location services
npm install expo-location --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Permissions Configuration

#### iOS (app.json)
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription": "This app needs location access to send your location during emergencies.",
        "NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription": "This app needs location access to send your location during emergencies."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Android (app.json)
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "permissions": [
        "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION",
        "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration

- Test permission denial and re-request
- Test location accuracy in different environments

### 2. **Emergency Flow Testing**
- Test SOS button with location enabled
- Test SOS button with location disabled
- Test emergency contact notifications
- Test doctor portal alert reception

### 3. **Edge Cases**
- Test with poor GPS signal
- Test with airplane mode
- Test with multiple simultaneous alerts
- Test alert acknowledgment and resolution

## Monitoring & Analytics

2. **Inaccurate location**: Ensure GPS is enabled and device has clear sky view
3. **Alerts not received**: Verify doctor-patient connections and notification settings
4. **Maps not opening**: Check device's default maps application settings

### Debug Information
- Location service logs in `LocationService`
- Emergency alert logs in `EmergencyService`
- Firebase console for real-time data monitoring
- Device console for permission and GPS issues
